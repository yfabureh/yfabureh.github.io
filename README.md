# **DATA WRANGLING PROJECT**

I started this project to demostrate my data wrangling skills and also show me joining and shaping messy data in a form that would make it ready for analysis. I used two data files for this project. The main data file was too big to upload on github, however, you can view the Dataframe from the results window on the Notebook file. 

The the main file is a section of the Gambia Integrated Household Survey (2015) which is basically census data that is collected in my home country of Gambia. This file was too big to upload on github, however, you can view the from the results window on the Notebook file. 

The second is an excel file that I created in order to decode the categorical variables from numericals to strings that can be understood. The file contains multiple sheets for multiple different variable keys.

Method: I used the Pandas Library in order to complete this project and also completed basic summary statistics and one history to complete the project

**Conclusion**: I was successful in gathering the data I needed, creating a variable key for my data because it was not available to me, dealing with null values, and shaping and joining my different data files together. Thank you!
